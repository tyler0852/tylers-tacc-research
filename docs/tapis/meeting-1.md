# Meeting 1: February 2nd, 2026

## What Got Done

### Read First 4 Chapters of TRPL

### Created `hello_cli`

- I chose `Clap` because it seems like it is the most common, supported, and documented crate for CLIs

- Resources:
    - [Clap crate](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/)
    - <https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/>
