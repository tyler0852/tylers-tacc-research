# Meeting 2: February 9th, 2026

## What Got Done

### Created `tms_loadtesting_suite`

- GitHub: [tms loadtesting suite](https://github.com/tyler0852/tms_loadtesting_suite)
- Fixed `getkey` endpoint!
- Created a script `testing_suite.py`
- Has 3 different levels of test (smoke, ladder, soak)
- You can run any combination of test and endpoints you want to hit

## Road Blockers
- When doing some testing this morning I think I may have crashed the dev server but have no way of turning it back on

## What's Next
- Could add local testing abilities so I don't have to rely on the dev server to the test suite
- Expand my cli to call a tapis endpoint
- Start learning about device grants
